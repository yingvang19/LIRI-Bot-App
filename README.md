## _LIRI-Bot-App_
## _Overview of the App_
In this project, I have made a LIRI Bot running on the Node.js with the JavaScript programming language. This LIRI Bot is like the major voice assistants like Siri to the IPhone, Google Assistant to the Google Pixel, and Bixby Voice to the Samsung phones. When a person ask something, this app recognize the voices and finishes the task. However, these devices does Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, as for the LIRI Bot it is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. The LIRI Bot that I have saved, as a GIF file will demonstrate using the command line in PowerShell/Terminal.

## _App Outcomes_
The LIRI Bot will produce search results based on the following commands lines in PowerShell/ Terminal:
* node liri.js spotify-this-song
*node liri.js movie-this
*node liri.js concert-this  
*node liri.js do-what-it-says


## This command searches songs from the _Spotify requested API_.
